# Code Challenge -SPA

## Requirement Summary
   Create an SPA using React, Vue.js, Angular, or Svelte for updating a userâ€™s profile. All
data should be stored and loaded from local storage. There are no API endpoints to
retrieve data.

## What was Used?
- Typescript: Good typing mitigates unexpected data issues!
- Vite: It's faster then create-react-app and starts you off with less things you don't need
- React: It's got context and state and is a popular framework!
- Material UI (MUI): To make things pretty quickly
  - mui-tel-input: So I don't have to validate phone numbers
- React-Router: To handle routing in the SPA
- React-Hook-Form: handles things like field validation and state management for forms very well
- UUID: to generate unique IDs for the profile data
